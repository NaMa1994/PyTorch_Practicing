# Saving and Loading Models in PyTorch

This guide explains how to save and load models efficiently in PyTorch. It focuses on saving only the model's state dictionary (parameters and buffers) rather than the entire model, highlighting the reasons for this best practice.

## Key Functions for Model Saving and Loading

1. **`torch.save()`**:
   - Saves the model's state dictionary, which is a Python dictionary containing:
     - Trainable parameters (weights and biases).
     - Registered buffers (e.g., batch normalization running averages).
   - Example:
     ```python
     torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model_state.pth")
     ```

2. **`torch.load_state_dict()`**:
   - Loads a state dictionary into a model instance.
   - Example:
     ```python
     model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model_state.pth"))
     ```

3. **`torch.load()`**:
   - Loads serialized data from a file. Used with `torch.save()` to reload the state dictionary.
   - Example:
     ```python
     state_dict = torch.load("model_state.pth")
     ```

## Why Not Save the Complete Model?

Instead of saving the entire model, it's recommended to save only the state dictionary. Here's why:

### 1. **Flexibility**:
   - Saving the entire model stores its class definition, structure, and parameters.
   - Reloading the model requires the exact same codebase and environment where it was saved, leading to compatibility issues if the class definition changes.

### 2. **Portability**:
   - State dictionaries are more portable since they only contain the parameters.
   - The model architecture can be reconstructed independently, and the parameters can be loaded afterward.

### 3. **Efficiency**:
   - Saves only the learnable parameters and buffers, which are essential for model functionality.
   - Reduces storage size compared to saving the full model.

## Best Practice for Saving and Loading

### Saving a Model:
1. Save only the state dictionary:
   ```python
   torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model_state.pth")
   ```

2. Loading a Model:
   ```pyhton
   model = LinearRegressionTorch(input_size=1, output_size=1)
   model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model_state.pth"))
   model.eval()

   
   ```

## When to Save the Entire Model?

Saving the entire model using torch.save(model, "model.pth") can be helpful in quick prototyping or debugging, but it's generally discouraged in production or long-term projects because:

It tightly couples the saved file with the exact codebase and environment.
It increases storage size unnecessarily.
By saving only the state dictionary, you gain better flexibility, portability, and maintainability.
